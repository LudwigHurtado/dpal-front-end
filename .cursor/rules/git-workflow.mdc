# Git workflow

When you complete code changes in this project:

1. **Stage** all relevant changed and new files: `git add <files>` (or `git add -A` for everything).
2. **Commit** with a clear, short message describing the change.
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push`.

Do not leave changes only committed locally unless the user explicitly asks to skip push (e.g. "commit but don't push").
