# DPAL Front-End

Vite 6 + React 19 + TypeScript SPA — the main DPAL citizen-reporting and environmental monitoring platform. Deployed on **Vercel**; API calls go to a **Railway** Node/MongoDB backend (`dpal-ai-server`).

---

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in secrets (see below)
npm install
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build    # → dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production bundle locally
```

Type-check:

```bash
npm run lint     # tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Environment variables

All Vite-exposed variables must start with `VITE_`. Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `VITE_API_BASE` | Yes | Railway backend origin, e.g. `https://web-production-a27b.up.railway.app` |
| `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional* | Client-side Gemini key — exposed in bundle; prefer `VITE_USE_SERVER_AI` for production |
| `VITE_USE_SERVER_AI` | Optional* | `true` → AI goes via `POST /api/ai/gemini` on the backend (no browser key needed) |
| `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional | Politician Transparency — query refine + evidence draft |
| `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL` | Optional | Default `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `VITE_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Optional | Live web search |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Optional | Locator / Places |
| `VITE_LAYOUT_VERSION` | Optional | `v1` or `v2` (hub layout experiment) |

\* At least one of `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` or `VITE_USE_SERVER_AI=true` is needed for AI features.

Backend-only satellite credentials live on Railway, not in Vercel. Sentinel-1 SAR uses Copernicus / Sentinel Hub OAuth credentials on the API server:

| Railway variable | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `COPERNICUS_CLIENT_ID` | Sentinel Hub / Copernicus OAuth client id |
| `COPERNICUS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Sentinel Hub / Copernicus OAuth client secret |

After changing Railway variables, redeploy or restart the backend service so the running Node process reads the new values.

## DPAL Mission Ops Phaser game

The `/games` Play & Learn hub now includes **DPAL Mission Ops**, an embedded Phaser mission game mounted through `features/mission-game/MissionGameView.tsx`.

Current flow:

1. The user opens `/games`, chooses Mission Ops, and React mounts the Phaser game inline.
2. `BootScene` launches the persistent `UIScene` overlay and starts `WorldMapScene`.
3. `WorldMapScene` shows the uploaded city map image, renders mission markers from config, and opens `MissionDetailScene` when a marker is clicked.
4. `MissionDetailScene` receives `{ mission, location, allMissions }`, shows mission details, and starts `MissionActionScene` from the Start Mission button.
5. `MissionActionScene` runs a session-only checklist: confirm location, inspect issue, collect related item, upload proof.
6. Completing all tasks unlocks Submit Proof, updates session player state, marks the mission complete, and opens `RewardScene`.
7. `RewardScene` shows earned XP, DPAL points, badge progress, updated community score, and returns to the map.

Map integration:

- Main map asset: `public/games/172e7fa5-6b48-43b2-ba01-6beaa662bc16.png`
- Swappable map settings: `features/mission-game/game/config/worldMapLayout.ts`
- Marker coordinates are kept outside the scene in `WORLD_MAP_MARKER_POSITIONS`, with normalized `x` / `y` values plus `district` and `categoryId`.
- The uploaded image already contains district labels, so Phaser does not draw duplicate district text over the map.

State is in-session only for now through the mission game player state manager. There is no backend persistence yet.

## Recent monitoring updates

- Main page monitoring imagery now uses dedicated assets in `public/main-screen/`:
  - `land-mineral-monitoring.png` for Ecological Conservation and Carbon MRV Engine
  - `water-project-monitoring.png` for Water Satellite Monitor
  - `satellite-water-analysis.png` for Earth Observation
- Category card imagery for Earth Observation, Ecological Conservation, and Water Violations points at those same assets through `categoryCardAssets.ts`.
- Mineral detector readings now separate verified bedrock/mineral indicators from EMIT dust-source availability. When Macrostrat geology is available, the UI can show a specific primary mineral and composition share even if EMIT dust area is unavailable.
- Water Monitor Sentinel-1 SAR now shows a clearly labeled fallback estimate card when the backend returns SAR estimate fields with `sentinel1.ok: false`. A verified SAR card only appears when the backend returns a live, verified Sentinel-1 scene.
- Git author identity for this repo is set to `LudwigHurtado <49735409+LudwigHurtado@users.noreply.github.com>` so future GitHub/Vercel deployments attribute commits to the correct account.

```

Demo / offline mode: the Carbon Credit Market and Ecological Conservation both fall back to localStorage-backed simulation or deterministic demo data when the API is unreachable, so the full UX is usable without a live backend.

## Deploying

Push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys. After updating env vars in the Vercel dashboard, trigger a manual redeploy so the new values are baked in.

For the Railway backend, push to `main` in `dpal-ai-server` → Railway auto-deploys. Smoke check:

```
GET https://web-production-a27b.up.railway.app/health
GET https://web-production-a27b.up.railway.app/api/ai/status   → { ok: true, gemini: true }
```

- `Run MRV Review` -> MRV results screen
- `Prepare Buyer Package` -> buyer packaging screen
- Buyer marketplace items -> project detail screen
- Buyer pipeline items -> deal detail modal

### AFOLU mission launch flow

- Mission flow now starts with `Select Mission Type` instead of a generic form step
- Supported mission types:
  - `Plant Trees`
  - `Patrol Protected Area`
  - `Verify Sample Plot`
  - `Fire Recovery`
  - `Agroforestry`
- Guided steps:
  1. `Select Mission Type`
  2. `Mission Definition`
  3. `Participants & Roles`
  4. `Verification Requirements`
  5. `Monitoring & Tracking`
  6. `Deploy Mission`
- The flow shows expected `tCO2e`, impact type, and “what this proves” before deployment
- After deploy, the UI opens a `Mission Live View` with active status, progress, submissions, and map activity placeholder
